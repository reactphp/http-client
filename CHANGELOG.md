    $request = $client->request('GET', 'http://localhost/');
    $request->on('response', function (Response $response) {
        // â€¦
    });
    $request->end();

## 0.5.0 (2017-05-22)

*   Feature / BC break: Replace `Factory` with simple `Client` constructor

    The `Client` now accepts a required `LoopInterface` and an optional
    `ConnectorInterface`. It will now create a default `Connector` if none
    has been given.

    ```php
    // old
    $dnsResolverFactory = new React\Dns\Resolver\Factory();
    $dnsResolver = $dnsResolverFactory->createCached('8.8.8.8', $loop);
    $factory = new React\HttpClient\Factory();
    $client = $factory->create($loop, $dnsResolver);

    // new
    $client = new React\HttpClient\Client($loop);
    ```

*   Feature: `Request::close()` now cancels pending connection attempt
